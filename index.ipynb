    "ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load. It’s a process used in data management to move data from various sources into a centralized data place for analysis and reporting. Here's a breakdown of each step:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extract: This is the process of gathering raw data from various sources such as databases, flat files, APIs, or web scraping. The goal is to extract data in its raw form, without changing or processing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Transform: Once the data is extracted, it often needs to be cleaned, formatted, or aggregated. This step might include filtering out unwanted data, correcting errors, converting data types, merging different data sources, or performing calculations to prepare the data for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Load: After transforming the data, it’s loaded into the target destination, which could be a database, data warehouse, or data lake. This is where it’s stored in a structured format that can be queried and analyzed."

I wanted a little desert so I went to this doughnut shop it seemed clean enough so I made my selections and took them home. Mistake should have eaten one there I would have ask for my money back. I took a bite out of each on to confirm what I thought they were the worst doughnuts I have ever had. Horrible not sure if the oils was rancid or not hot enough either way eat at your own risk.",

Make sure to also order the garlic sauce and red meat sauce for dipping. It's a warm atmosphere with a very friendly staff. I've gotten many friends hooked on this place. 5/5.",

My job was pushed back for weeks and nothing was communicated to me. On top of that I am now having to report them to my bank as fraud since they have yet to return the upfront money I gave them. Horrible horrible experience all the way around! I wouldn't even give them 1 star but that is the lowest it would allow me to select. I just hope my bank is able to get the money back soon from these rat b@stards!!",
